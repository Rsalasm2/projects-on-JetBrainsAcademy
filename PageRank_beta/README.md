# About

We all use Google. 
How does Google manage to return a relevant set of web pages for your search in a blink of an eye? 
In this project, you will have a chance to implement your own ranking algorithm for web pages based on the technology they use in Google - PageRank.


# Learning outcomes

As a result of completing the project you are going to implement your own web pages ranking algorithm with PageRank as a core. 
On the way, we will review the basic linear algebra required for this project. 
You will also get hands-on experience with Numpy mathematical package.
