# About

Sitting down with a coffee and reading a newspaper is pretty much a thing of the past. Most people today read the news on their laptops or phones, 
so online news websites are very popular. 
Some, like The New York Times, originate from offline press, but most new websites today were originally created as purely online resources, 
and they all share the same basic structure. 
In this project, you will use Django to create an online news web application.

# Learning outcomes
You will learn the basics of Django: how to handle data through HTTP and work with templates. 
You will also gain new skills for working with JSON files and the Python DateTime type.
